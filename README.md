![plusql](plusql.png) 

An [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) command line interface ([CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)) that's similar to Oracle&reg;'s [SQL*Plus](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/oracle-sqlplus-the/0596007469/), except it works for PostgreSQL.

`PluSQL` is written in Python3 and runs on Windows or Linux .   It is still a pre-alpha project.  In these early days I am building the basic plumbing.

Our customer friendly licensing model is [SSPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Public_License) which is a source-available model based on [GPL3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html) with the addition of a new section (Section 13) that requires that those making SSPL-licensed software available to third-parties (modified or not) as part of a "service" must release the source code for the entirety of the service.
