A command line SQL interface that's similar to Oracle&reg;'s SQL*Plus&reg;, but... it also works as a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for SQLite&reg;, PostgreSQL&reg;, MySQL&reg; &amp; Microsoft&reg;'s SQL Server&reg; also.  

PluSQL is written in Python 3 and leverages [SQL Alchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/features.html) for RDBMS independance.   This is still a pre-alpha hobby project for me.  In these early days I'm mostly just testing against a SQLite in-memory database whilst building the basic plumbing.
