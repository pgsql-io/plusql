An [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) command line interface ([CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)) that's similar to Oracle&reg;'s [SQL*Plus](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/oracle-sqlplus-the/0596007469/), but... it also works for [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html), [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org), and ...  

PluSQL is written in Python 3 and leverages [SQL Alchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/features.html) for RDBMS independance.   This is still a pre-alpha hobby project for me.  In these early days I'm mostly just testing against a SQLite in-memory database whilst building the basic plumbing.
