# plusql

![plusql](plusql.png) 

An [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) command line interface ([CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)) that's similar to Oracle&reg;'s [SQL*Plus](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/oracle-sqlplus-the/0596007469/), except it works for PostgreSQL.

`PluSQL` is written in Python3 and leverages [psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org) to access Postgres.   This is still a pre-alpha project.  In these early days I am building the basic plumbing.
